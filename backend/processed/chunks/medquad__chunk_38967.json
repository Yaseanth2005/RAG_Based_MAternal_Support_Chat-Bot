The conversion between proline and glutamate, and the reverse reaction controlled by different enzymes, are important in maintaining a supply of the amino acids needed for protein production, and for energy transfer within the cell.

A deficiency of the latter enzyme leads to higher levels of proline and a buildup of the intermediate"}
