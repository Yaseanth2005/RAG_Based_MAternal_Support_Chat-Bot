Mutations in the RASA1 gene lead to the production of a nonfunctional version of the p120-RasGAP protein. A loss of this protein's activity disrupts tightly regulated chemical signaling during development. However, it is unclear how these changes lead to the specific vascular abnormalities seen in people with CM-AVM.\",GHR,capillary malformation-arteriovenous malformation syndrome\nIs capillary malformation-arteriovenous malformation syndrome inherited"}
