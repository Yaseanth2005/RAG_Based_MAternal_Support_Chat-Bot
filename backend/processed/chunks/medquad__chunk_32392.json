Chronic HP can cause a worsening cough, shortness of breath with physical activity, fatigue (tiredness), and weight loss.\n                \nSome symptoms may continue and/or worsen, even after avoiding the antigen. Chronic HP can cause long-term lung damage, such as pulmonary fibrosis. This is a condition in which tissue deep in your lungs becomes scarred over time."}
