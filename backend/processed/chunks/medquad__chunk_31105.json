Carotid artery disease causes many of the ischemic strokes and TIAs that occur in the United States.\n                \nAn embolic stroke (a type of ischemic stroke) or TIA also can occur if a blood clot or piece of plaque breaks away from the wall of an artery. The clot or plaque can travel through the bloodstream and get stuck in one of the brains arteries. This stops blood flow through the artery and damages brain cells."}
