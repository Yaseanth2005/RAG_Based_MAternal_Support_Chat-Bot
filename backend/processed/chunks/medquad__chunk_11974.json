Non-genetic causes include lesions of the basal ganglia due to multiple sclerosis, tumors, and vascular lesions. In addition, lesions outside the basal ganglia (including those due to penetrating injury) have been reported as causing symptoms similar to those found in paroxysmal nonkinesigenic dyskinesia. In these situations, careful evaluation by a neurologist and neuroimaging (such as MRI) may be necessary for diagnosis.\",GA"}
