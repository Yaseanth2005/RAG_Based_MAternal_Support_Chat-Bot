This artery carries blood to the lungs to get oxygen.\n                \nAt the same time, the aortic valve opens to allow blood to flow from the left ventricle into the aorta.

This prevents blood from flowing back into the ventricles.\n                \nFor more information about how the heart pumps blood and detailed animations, go to the Health Topics"}
