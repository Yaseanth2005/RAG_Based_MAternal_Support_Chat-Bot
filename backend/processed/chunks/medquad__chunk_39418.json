This protein anchors cells to the lattice of proteins and other molecules (the extracellular matrix) that surrounds them. In skeletal muscles, -dystroglycan helps stabilize and protect muscle fibers. In the brain, this protein helps direct the movement (migration) of nerve cells (neurons) during early development.  The most common mutation in the FKTN gene reduces the amount of fukutin produced within cells. A shortage of fukutin likely preven"}
