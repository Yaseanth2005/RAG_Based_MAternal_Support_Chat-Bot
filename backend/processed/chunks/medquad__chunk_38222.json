The resulting degeneration of muscle tissue leads to the signs and symptoms of CAV3-related distal myopathy.  In addition to CAV3-related distal myopathy, CAV3 gene mutations can cause other caveolinopathies including limb-girdle muscular dystrophy, rippling muscle disease, isolated hyperCKemia, and a heart disorder called hypertr"}
