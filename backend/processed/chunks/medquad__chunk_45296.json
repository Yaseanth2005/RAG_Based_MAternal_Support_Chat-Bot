The proteins produced from the DCX and PAFAH1B1 genes promote neuronal migration by interacting with microtubules.  Mutations in any of these three genes impair the function of microtubules and the normal migration of neurons during fetal development. As a result, the layers of the cerebral cortex are disorganized and the normal folds and grooves of the brain do not form. This impairment of brain development leads to the smooth brain appeara"}
