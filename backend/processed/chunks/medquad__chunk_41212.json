This protein, called dyskerin, attaches (binds) to hTR and helps stabilize the telomerase complex.  The shelterin complex helps protect telomeres from the cell's DNA repair process. Without the protection of shelterin, the repair mechanism would sense the chromosome ends as abnormal breaks in the DNA sequence and either attempt to join the ends together or initiate apoptosis.
