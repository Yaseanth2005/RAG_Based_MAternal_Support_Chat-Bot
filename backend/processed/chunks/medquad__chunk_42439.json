The THAP1 protein also plays a role in the self-destruction of cells that are no longer needed (apoptosis).  Studies indicate that most of the THAP1 gene mutations that cause dystonia 6 affect the stability of the THAP1 protein, reducing the amount of functional THAP1 protein available for DNA binding. Other mutations may impair the protein's abili"}
