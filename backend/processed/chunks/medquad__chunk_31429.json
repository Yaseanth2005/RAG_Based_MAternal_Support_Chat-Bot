Plaque is made up of cholesterol, fat, calcium, and other substances found in the blood. When plaque builds up in the arteries, the condition is called atherosclerosis (ATH-er-o-skler-O-sis).\n                \nAtherosclerosis\n                \n\n                \nOver time, plaque hardens and narrows your coronary arteries. This limits the flow of oxygen-rich blood to the heart."}
