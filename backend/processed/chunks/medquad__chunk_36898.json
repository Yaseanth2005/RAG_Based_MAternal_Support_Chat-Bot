A buildup of proteins in the cell can cause it to die; motor neurons are particularly susceptible to damage from protein buildup.  The DYNC1H1 gene provides instructions for making a protein that is part of a group (complex) of proteins called dynein. This complex is found in the fluid inside cells (cytoplasm), where it is part of a network that moves proteins and other materials. In neurons, dynein moves cellular materials away from"}
