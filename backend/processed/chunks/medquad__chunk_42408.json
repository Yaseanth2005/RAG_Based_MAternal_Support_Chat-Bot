Specifically, guanidinoacetate methyltransferase controls the second step of this process. In this step, creatine is produced from another compound called guanidinoacetate. Creatine is needed for the body to store and use energy properly.  GAMT gene mutations impair the ability of the guanidinoacetate methyltransferase enzyme to participate in"}
