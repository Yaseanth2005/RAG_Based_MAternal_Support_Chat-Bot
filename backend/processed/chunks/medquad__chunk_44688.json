These genetic changes, which are called somatic mutations, probably occur very early in development and are present only in certain cells. Somatic mutations could explain why the signs and symptoms of Klippel-Trenaunay syndrome are often limited to specific areas of the body. However, it is unclear whether somatic mutations are responsible for this condition because no associated genes have been found.\",GHR,Klippel-Trena"}
