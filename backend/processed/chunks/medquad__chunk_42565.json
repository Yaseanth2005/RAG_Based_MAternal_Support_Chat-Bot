Mutations in the RYR1 gene change the structure of ryanodine receptor 1, allowing calcium ions to \"\"leak\"\" through the abnormal channel or impairing the channel's ability to release stored calcium ions at the correct time. This disruption in calcium ion transport prevents muscles from contracting normally, leading to the muscle weakness characteristic of central core disease.\",GHR,ce"}
