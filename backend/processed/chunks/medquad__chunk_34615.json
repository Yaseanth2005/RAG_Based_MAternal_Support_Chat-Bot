In about half of all cases, an affected person inherits the mutation from one affected parent. The other half of cases result from a new (de novo) mutation in the gene that occurs during the formation of reproductive cells (eggs or sperm) or in early embryonic development. These cases occur in people with no history of the disorder in their family.\",GHR,pachy"}
