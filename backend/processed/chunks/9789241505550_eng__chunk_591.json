The rate (y-axis) is probably more dependable than the intensity, although \nboth are somewhat uncertain. Above about 30 CHNWs/1000 children there are improvements of \n1–2 ppt/year. It has not been possible to extract the underlying (without programme) rate in most \ncases; however, it would usually not be more than -0.5 ppt/year. \nMost of the rate estimates are reasonably well known – T"}
