Other mutations introduce a premature stop signal that results in an abnormally short protein. Occasionally, the entire gene is missing.  These genetic changes reduce or eliminate the activity of the protein produced from one copy of the RUNX2 gene in each cell, decreasing the total amount of functional RUNX2 protein. This shortage of functional RUNX2 protein interferes with normal"}
