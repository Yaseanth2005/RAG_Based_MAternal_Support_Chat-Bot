This helps keep the lungs open so breathing can occur after birth.\n                \nWithout enough surfactant, the lungs will likely collapse when the infant exhales (breathes out). The infant then has to work harder to breathe. He or she might not be able to get enough oxygen to support the body's organs.\n                \nSome full-term infants develop RDS because they have faulty genes that affect how their bodies make surfactant.\",NHLBI,"}
