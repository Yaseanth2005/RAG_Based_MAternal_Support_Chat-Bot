This enzyme is necessary for making glycogen, a major source of stored energy in the body. Glycogen is formed by assembling many molecules of glucose. The glycogen branching enzyme is involved in the formation of \"\"branches\"\" of glucose chains, which help to make glycogen more compact for storage and allows it to break down more easily when it is needed for energy.
