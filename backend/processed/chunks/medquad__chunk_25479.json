This means they result from a new mutation in one of the responsible genes (KRT1 or KRT10), in people with no family history of EI. However, while people with sporadic EI did not inherit the condition from a parent, they may still pass the condition on to their children. Inherited cases of EI usually have an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern. This means that having a mutation in only one copy of KRT1 or KRT10 in each cell is enough to cause features of the condition."}
