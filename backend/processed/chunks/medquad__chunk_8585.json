There are four main types of skin biopsies:               -  Shave biopsy : A sterile razor blade is used to shave-off the abnormal-looking growth.      -  Punch biopsy : A special instrument called a punch or a trephine is used to remove a circle of tissue from the abnormal-looking growth.      -  Incisional biopsy : A scalpel is used to remove part of a growth."}
