Several devices have been developed that may help with CPT, such as:\n                \nAn electric chest clapper, known as a mechanical percussor.\n                \nAn inflatable therapy vest that uses high-frequency airwaves to force the mucus that's deep in your lungs toward your upper airways so you can cough it up.\n                \nA small, handheld device that you exhale through. The device causes vibrations that dislodge the mucus."}
