These factors include:\n                \nA respiratory (RES-pih-rah-tor-e) system that has to work harder than normal and perhaps differently because of excess body weight. (The respiratory system is a group of organs and tissues, including the lungs, that helps you breathe.)\n                \nA slow response by the body to fix the problem of too much carbon dioxide and too little oxygen in the blood."}
