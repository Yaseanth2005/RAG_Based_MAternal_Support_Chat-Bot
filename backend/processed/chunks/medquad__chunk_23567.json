It is unclear exactly how HSPB1 mutations lead to the axon abnormalities characteristic of CMT2F. Researchers suggest that mutations lead to an altered protein which clusters together and interferes with nerve cell function. Another possibility is that the altered protein disrupts the assembly of neurofilaments, which in turn may impair the transmission o"}
