COL8A2 gene mutations that cause the early-onset variant of Fuchs endothelial dystrophy lead to an abnormal Descemet's membrane, which causes the cells to die and leads to the vision problems in people with this condition.

The genetic causes of the late-onset form of the disorder are unknown.\",GHR,Fuchs endothelial dystrophy\nIs Fuc"}
