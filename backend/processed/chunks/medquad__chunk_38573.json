Some MECP2 gene mutations that cause PPM-X syndrome disrupt attachment (binding) of the MeCP2 protein to DNA, and other mutations alter the 3-dimensional shape of the protein. These mutations lead to the production of a MeCP2 protein that cannot properly interact with DNA or other proteins and so cannot control the expression of genes.
