Many of the genes associated with CdLS encode proteins that play an important role in human development before birth. Mutations in these genes may result in an abnormal protein that is not able to carry out its normal function. This is thought to interfere with early development leading to the many signs and symptoms of CdLS. In 30% of people with CdLS, the underlying genetic cause of the condition is unknown.\",GARD,Cornelia d"}
