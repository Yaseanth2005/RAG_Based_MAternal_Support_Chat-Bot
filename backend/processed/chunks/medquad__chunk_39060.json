The genetic cause of CDA type III has not been identified. It likely results from mutations in a gene located on the long arm of chromosome 15 at a position designated 15q22. Researchers continue to search for the specific gene associated with this form of the condition.  The genetic changes responsible for CDA disrupt the normal development of red blood cells, a process called eryt"}
