Thus, they may not be able to pump enough blood to the lungs and body. This can lead to signs and symptoms, such as:\n                \nPalpitations (feelings that your heart is skipping a beat, fluttering, or beating too hard or fast)\n                \nShortness of breath\n                \nWeakness or problems exercising"}
