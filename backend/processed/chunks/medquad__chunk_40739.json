These two genes provide instructions for making different parts (subunits) of an enzyme called 3-methylcrotonyl-coenzyme A carboxylase (3-MCC). This enzyme plays a critical role in breaking down proteins obtained from the diet. Specifically, 3-MCC is responsible for the fourth step in processing leucin"}
