The following situations may change the length of treatment:\n                \nIf your blood clot occurred after a short-term risk (for example, surgery), your treatment time may be shorter.\n                \nIf you've had blood clots before, your treatment time may be longer.\n                \nIf you have certain other illnesses, such as cancer, you may need to take blood thinners for as long as you have the illness."}
