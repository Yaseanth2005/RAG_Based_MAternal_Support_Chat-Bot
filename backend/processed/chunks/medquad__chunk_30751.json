This disorder occurs if the area of your brain that controls your breathing doesn't send the correct signals to your breathing muscles. As a result, you'll make no effort to breathe for brief periods.\n                \nCentral sleep apnea can affect anyone. However, it's more common in people who have certain medical conditions or use certain medicines.\n                \nCentral sleep apnea can occur with obstructive sleep apnea or alone."}
