Scientists looking for the cause of PD continue to search for possible environmental factors, such as toxins, that may trigger the disorder, and study genetic factors to determine how defective genes play a role. Other scientists are working to develop new protective drugs that can delay, prevent, or reverse the disease.\n                \nhttp://www.ninds.nih.gov/research/parkinsonsweb/index.htm\",NI"}
