The loss of these brain cells causes some of the movement problems characteristic of ataxia-telangiectasia. Mutations in the ATM gene also prevent cells from responding correctly to DNA damage, which allows breaks in DNA strands to accumulate and can lead to the formation of cancerous tumors.\",GHR,ataxia-telangiectasia\nIs ataxia-telangiectasia inherited ?,\"Ataxia-telangiectasia is inherited"}
