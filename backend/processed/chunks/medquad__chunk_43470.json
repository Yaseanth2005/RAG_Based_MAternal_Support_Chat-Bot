Mutations in the SCN4A gene alter the usual structure and function of sodium channels. The altered channels cannot properly regulate ion flow, increasing the movement of sodium ions into skeletal muscle cells. The influx of extra sodium ions triggers prolonged muscle contractions, which are the hallmark of myotonia.\",GHR,potassium-aggravated myotonia\nIs potassium-aggravated myotonia inherited ?,\"Potassium-aggravated my"}
