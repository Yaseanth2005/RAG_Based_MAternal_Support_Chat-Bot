The septum prevents blood from mixing between the two sides of the heart.\n                \nA VSD is a hole in the septum between the heart's two lower chambers, the ventricles. The hole allows oxygen-rich blood from the left ventricle to mix with oxygen-poor blood from the right ventricle.\n                \nPulmonary Stenosis\n                \nThis defect involves narrowing of the pulmonary valve and the passage from the right ventricle to the pulmonary artery."}
