Also, because too many AAT proteins are stuck in the liver, liver disease can develop.\n                \nSevere AAT deficiency occurs if blood levels of the AAT protein fall below the lowest amount needed to protect the lungs.\n                \nAAT deficiency is an inherited condition. \"\"Inherited\"\" means it's passed from parents to children through genes."}
