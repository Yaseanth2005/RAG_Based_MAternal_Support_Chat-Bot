The mutations probably reduce the activity of glycyl-tRNA synthetase. A reduction in the activity of this enzyme may impair transmission of nerve impulses. As a result, nerve cells slowly lose the ability to communicate with muscles in the hands and feet.  Mutations in other genes may also cause distal hereditary motor neuropathy, type V.\",GHR,\"distal hereditary motor neuropathy, t"}
