Symptoms in these patients varied greatly but often involved pronounced neurological symptoms and blood vessel disease. The age of the patients when they first experienced symptoms varied from infancy to adulthood. Common MTHFR gene mutations cause less severe, although still significantly raised levels of homocysteine. The most well studied MTHFR mutation, is C677T."}
