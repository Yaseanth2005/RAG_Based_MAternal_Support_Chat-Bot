Elastin binding protein plays a role in the formation of elastic fibers, a component of the connective tissues that form the body's supportive framework.  CTSA mutations interfere with the normal function of cathepsin A. Most mutations disrupt the protein structure of cathepsin A, impairing its ability to form complexes with neuraminidase 1, beta-galactosidase, and elastin binding protein. As a result, these other enzymes are n"}
