Because almost all of the iron transported into erythroblasts is normally incorporated into heme, the reduced production of heme leads to a buildup of excess iron in these cells.

Low hemoglobin levels and the resulting accumulation of iron in the body's organs lead to the characteristic features of X-li"}
