As in bone cells, the TRAP enzyme inactivates osteopontin in immune cells when it is no longer needed.  The ACP5 gene mutations that cause SPENCDI impair or eliminate TRAP's ability to inactivate osteopontin. As a result, osteopontin is abnormally active, prolonging bone breakdown by osteoclasts and triggering abnormal inflammation and immune respons"}
