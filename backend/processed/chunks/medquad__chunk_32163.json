An EKG shows how fast the heart is beating and its rhythm (steady or irregular). An EKG also records the strength and timing of electrical signals as they pass through each part of the heart.\n                \nThis test is used to detect and locate the source of heart problems. The results from an EKG also may be used to rule out certain heart problems.\n                \nEchocard"}
