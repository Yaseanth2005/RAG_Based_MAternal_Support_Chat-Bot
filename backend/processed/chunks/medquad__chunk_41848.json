{"chunk_id": "medquad__chunk_41848", "source": "medquad", "text": "ic changes related to myostatin-related muscle hypertrophy ?,\"Mutations in the MSTN gene cause myostatin-related muscle hypertrophy. The MSTN gene provides instructions for making a protein called myostatin, which is active in muscles used for movement (skeletal muscles) both before and after birth. This protein normally restrains muscle growth, ensuring that muscles do not grow too large. Mutations that reduce the production of functional myostatin lead to an overgrowth of muscle tissue.\",GHR,m"}
