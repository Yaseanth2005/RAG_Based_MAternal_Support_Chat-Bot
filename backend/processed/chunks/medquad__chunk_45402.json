{"chunk_id": "medquad__chunk_45402", "source": "medquad", "text": "y (expression) of the FTL gene is stopped to prevent too much ferritin light chain from being produced. This normally occurs when iron levels are low, because under those circumstances less ferritin is needed to store the iron. Mutations in the IRE segment of the FTL gene prevent it from binding with IRP, interfering with the mechanism by which ferritin production is matched to iron levels and resulting in excess ferritin being formed.\",GHR,hyperferritinemia-cataract syndrome\nIs hyperferritinemi"}
