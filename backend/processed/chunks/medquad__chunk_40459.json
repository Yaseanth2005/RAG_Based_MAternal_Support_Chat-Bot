This pathway plays roles in cell growth, cell specialization, and the normal shaping (patterning) of many parts of the body.

It is unclear how the defective proteins lead to the specific signs and symptoms of this condition. Studies suggest that they prevent normal Sonic Hedgehog signaling in the"}
