Infants with the acute neonatal form typically appear normal at birth, but as ammonia builds up in the body they become progressively lethargic, feed poorly, vomit, and develop signs of increased intracranial pressure, which can lead to seizures and loss of consciousness. Less commonly, a milder form of citrullinemia type I can develop later in childhood or adulthood."}
