To diagnose paroxysmal AF, your doctor may ask you to wear a portable EKG monitor that can record your heartbeat for longer periods.\n                \nThe two most common types of portable EKGs are Holter and event monitors.\n                \nHolter and Event Monitors\n                \nA Holter monitor records the heart's electrical activity for a full 24- or 48-hour period."}
