If it causes signs or symptoms, your doctor will try to find and treat the condition that's causing it.\n                \nHypotension can be dangerous. It can make you fall because of dizziness or fainting. Shock, a severe form of hypotension, is a condition that's often fatal if not treated right away. With prompt and proper treatment, shock can be successfully treated."}
