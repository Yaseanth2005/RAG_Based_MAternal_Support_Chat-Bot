This painless test uses sound waves to create a moving picture of your heart.\n                \nEcho shows the size and shape of your heart and how well your heart chambers and valves are working. The test also can show areas of heart muscle that aren't contracting normally because of poor blood flow or injury to the heart muscle."}
