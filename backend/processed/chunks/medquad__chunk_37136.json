{"chunk_id": "medquad__chunk_37136", "source": "medquad", "text": "spastic paraplegia type 8. The KIAA0196 gene provides instructions for making a protein called strumpellin. Strumpellin is active (expressed) throughout the body, although its exact function is unknown. The protein's structure suggests that strumpellin may interact with the structural framework inside cells (the cytoskeleton) and may attach (bind) to other proteins.  KIAA0196 gene mutations are thought to change the structure of the strumpellin protein. It is unknown how the altered strumpellin"}
