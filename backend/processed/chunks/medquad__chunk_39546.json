The most common deletion, which occurs in about 20 percent of affected individuals, removes 4,997 nucleotides.  The mtDNA deletions involved in Pearson marrow-pancreas syndrome result in the loss of genes that provide instructions for proteins involved in oxidative phosphorylation. These deletions impair oxidative phosphorylation and decrease the energy available to cells. It is no"}
