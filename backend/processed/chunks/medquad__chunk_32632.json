The disorder is more common in premature infants born about 6 weeks or more before their due dates.\n                \nRDS is more common in premature infants because their lungs aren't able to make enough surfactant (sur-FAK-tant). Surfactant is a liquid that coats the inside of the lungs. It helps keep them open so that infants can breathe in air once they're born."}
