As a result, the holoenzymes are either partially assembled or not assembled at all. Without complete holoenzymes, cytochrome c oxidase cannot form. Mutations in the three mitochondrial genes and a few nuclear genes that provide instructions for making the holoenzyme subunits can also cause cytochrome c oxidase deficiency. Altered subunit proteins reduce the function of the holoenzymes, resulting in a nonfunctional version of cytochrome"}
