The HBB gene provides instructions for making a protein called beta-globin. Beta-globin is a component (subunit) of hemoglobin. Hemoglobin consists of four protein subunits, typically two subunits of beta-globin and two subunits of another protein called alpha-globin.  Some mutations in the HBB gene prevent the production of any beta-globin. The absence of beta-globin is referred to"}
