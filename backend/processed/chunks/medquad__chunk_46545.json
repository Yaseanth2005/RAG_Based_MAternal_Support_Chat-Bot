For example, on cell surfaces, insulin receptor molecules capture, or bind, insulin molecules circulating in the bloodstream. This interaction between insulin and its receptor prompts the biochemical signals that enable the cells to absorb glucose from the blood and use it for energy.\n                \nProblems in cell signaling systems can set off a chain reaction that leads to diabetes or other diseases. Many studies have focuse"}
