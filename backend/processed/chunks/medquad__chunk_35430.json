The function of the protein produced from this gene is not well understood, although it is thought to play a role in bone growth and cartilage maintenance. The WISP3 protein is made in cells called chondrocytes, which produce and maintain cartilage. This protein is associated with the production of certain proteins that make up cartilage, but its role in their production is unclear. WISP3 may also help control signaling pathway"}
