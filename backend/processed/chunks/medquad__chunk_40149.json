{"chunk_id": "medquad__chunk_40149", "source": "medquad", "text": "re the genetic changes related to distal hereditary motor neuropathy, type V ?\",\"Mutations in the BSCL2 and GARS genes cause distal hereditary motor neuropathy, type V.  The BSCL2 gene provides instructions for making a protein called seipin, whose function is unknown. Mutations in the BSCL2 gene likely alter the structure of seipin, causing it to fold into an incorrect 3-dimensional shape. Research findings indicate that misfolded seipin proteins accumulate in the endoplasmic reticulum, which i"}
