Carnitine-acylcarnitine translocase deficiency occurs when an enzyme, called \"\"carnitine-acylcarnitine translocase\"\" (CAT), is either missing or not working properly. This enzyme's job is to help change certain fats in the food we eat into energy. It also helps to break down fat already stored in the body. Energy from fat keeps us going whenever our bodies run low of their main source of energy,"}
