The fused gene produces a protein which some believe may stimulate cells to multiply, leading to the tumor formation seen in dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans. This type of gene change is generally found only in tumor cells and is not inherited.\",GARD,Dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans\n\"What is (are) Famili"}
