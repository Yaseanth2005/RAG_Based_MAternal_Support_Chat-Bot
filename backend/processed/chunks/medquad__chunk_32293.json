Primary hemochromatosis is caused by a defect in the genes that control how much iron you absorb from food. Secondary hemochromatosis usually is the result of another disease or condition that causes iron overload.\n                \nMost people who have primary hemochromatosis inherit it from their parents. If you inherit two hemochromatosis genesone from each parentyou're at risk for iron overload and signs and symptoms of the disease."}
