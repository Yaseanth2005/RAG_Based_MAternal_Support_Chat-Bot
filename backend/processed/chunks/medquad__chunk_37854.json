Melanosomes are formed near the center of melanocytes, but they must be transported to the outer edge of these cells and then transferred into other types of cells to provide normal pigmentation.

As a result, these structures clump near the center of melanocytes, trapping melanin within these cells and preventing normal pigmentation"}
