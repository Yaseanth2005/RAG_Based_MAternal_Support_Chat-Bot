In about 10% of people with OI, the COL1A1 and COL1A2 genes are normal and the condition is due to mutations in other genes; many of these people have an autosomal recessive form of OI. Other genes in which mutations may be responsible for less common types of OI, some of which have been reported in only one individual or family, include: IFITM5 (type V) SERPINF1 (type VI) CRTAP (type VII) LEPRE1, also called P3H1 (type VIII)"}
