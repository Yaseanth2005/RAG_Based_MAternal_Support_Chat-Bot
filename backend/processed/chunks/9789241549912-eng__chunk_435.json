The study, conducted in Malawi, assessed \nthe test accuracy of on-site Hb testing with a \nhaemoglobinometer (HemoCue®) and the HCS \nmethod in comparison to a full blood count test \nperformed by an electronic counter (Coulter counter), \nthe reference standard. \nModerate-certainty evidence shows that the \nsensitivity and specificity of the haemoglobinometer \ntest in detecting anaemia (Hb < 110 g/L) are \napproximately 0.85 (95% CI: 0.79–0.90) and \n0.80 (95% CI: 0.76–0.83"}
