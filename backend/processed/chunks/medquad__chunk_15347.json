{"chunk_id": "medquad__chunk_15347", "source": "medquad", "text": "e). In males (who have only one X chromosome), a duplication of the MECP2 gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the condition. In females (who have two X chromosomes), a duplication of one of the two copies of the gene typically does not cause the disorder. Early in the development of females, one of the two X chromosomes is randomly and permanently inactivated in each cell (called X-inactivation). X-inactivation prevents female cells from having twice as many functional X chromosomes as male"}
