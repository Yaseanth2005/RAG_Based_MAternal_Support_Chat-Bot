The spleen is an organ in the abdomen. A healthy spleen helps fight infection and filters out old or damaged blood cells.\n                \nAn enlarged or diseased spleen may remove more red blood cells than normal, causing anemia. Removing the spleen can stop or reduce high rates of red blood cell destruction."}
