Or, they can cause a more widespread brain infection called meningitis (men-in-JI-tis).\n                \nEmboli also can cause strokes or seizures. This happens if they block blood vessels or affect the brain's electrical signals. These complications can cause long-term damage to the brain and may even be fatal."}
