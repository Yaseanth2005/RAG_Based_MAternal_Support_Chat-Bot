This means regular checkups and tests to see whether the defect closes on its own or gets smaller.\n                \nMore than half of VSDs eventually close, usually by the time children are in preschool. Your child's doctor will let you know how often your child needs checkups. Checkups may range from once a month to once every 1 or 2 years."}
