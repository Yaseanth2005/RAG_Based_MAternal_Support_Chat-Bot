A lack of functional cytochrome c oxidase disrupts the last step of oxidative phosphorylation, causing a decrease in energy production.  Researchers believe that impaired oxidative phosphorylation can lead to cell death by reducing the amount of energy available in the cell. Certain tissues that require large amounts of energy, such as the brain, muscles, and heart, seem especially sensitive to decreases in cellular energy. Cell death"}
