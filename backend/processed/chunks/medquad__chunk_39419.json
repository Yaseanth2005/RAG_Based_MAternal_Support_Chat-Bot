A shortage of fukutin likely prevents the normal modification of -dystroglycan, which disrupts that protein's normal function.

The damaged fibers weaken and die over time, leading to progressive weakness and atrophy of the skeletal muscles.  Defective -dystroglycan also affects the migration of neurons during the early development of the brain. I"}
