Finding a mutation in this gene is necessary to confirm a diagnosis in a person with symptoms. Testing of the PRNP gene may not detect all disease-causing mutations, so if a mutation is not found, a person may still have the disease. Other studies such as EEG, brain imaging, or examining cerebrospinal fluid may be helpful in supporting a diagnosis, but none of these can diagnose a genetic prion disease"}
