These functions make PI3K important for the development of tissues throughout the body, including the brain and blood vessels.  PIK3CA gene mutations involved in MCAP alter the p110 protein. The altered subunit makes PI3K abnormally active, which allows cells to grow and divide continuously. Increased cell proliferation leads to the overgrowth of"}
