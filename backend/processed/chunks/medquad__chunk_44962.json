{"chunk_id": "medquad__chunk_44962", "source": "medquad", "text": "sulinism occurs when only some of the beta cells over-secrete insulin.  Most often, the diffuse form of congenital hyperinsulinism is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, which means both copies of the gene in each cell have mutations. The parents of an individual with an autosomal recessive condition each carry one copy of the mutated gene, but they typically do not show signs and symptoms of the condition.  Less frequently, the diffuse form is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern"}
