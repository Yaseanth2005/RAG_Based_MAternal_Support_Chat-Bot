This means that having only one changed (mutated) copy of the responsible gene in each cell is enough to cause signs and symptoms of the condition.  When a person with an autosomal dominant condition has children, each child has a 50% (1 in 2) risk to inherit the mutated gene from the affected parent. Children who do not inherit the mutated gene will not develop or pass on"}
