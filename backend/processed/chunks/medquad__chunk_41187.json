{"chunk_id": "medquad__chunk_41187", "source": "medquad", "text": "robiopterin deficiency can be caused by mutations in one of several genes, including GCH1, PCBD1, PTS, and QDPR. These genes provide instructions for making enzymes that help produce and recycle tetrahydrobiopterin in the body. Tetrahydrobiopterin normally helps process several amino acids, including phenylalanine. It is also involved in the production of neurotransmitters.  If one of the enzymes fails to function correctly because of a gene mutation, little or no tetrahydrobiopterin is availabl"}
