It's the most common test used to diagnose arrhythmias.\n                \nAn EKG shows how fast the heart is beating and its rhythm (steady or irregular). It also records the strength and timing of electrical signals as they pass through the heart.\n                \nA standard EKG only records the heartbeat for a few seconds."}
