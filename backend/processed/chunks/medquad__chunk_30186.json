The main goal of treatment is to prevent death and disability caused by bleeding.\n                \nIf your condition is mild, you may not need treatment. A fully normal platelet count isn't necessary to prevent bleeding, even with severe cuts or accidents.\n                \nThrombocytopenia often improves when its underlying cause is treated. People who inherit the condition usually don't need treatment."}
