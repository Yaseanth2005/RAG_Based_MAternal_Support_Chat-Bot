{"chunk_id": "medquad__chunk_43839", "source": "medquad", "text": "utyryl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency ?,\"Mutations in the ACADSB gene cause 2-methylbutyryl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency.  The ACADSB gene provides instructions for making an enzyme called 2-methylbutyryl-CoA dehydrogenase that helps process the amino acid isoleucine. Mutations in the ACADSB gene reduce or eliminate the activity of this enzyme. With a shortage (deficiency) of 2-methylbutyryl-CoA dehydrogenase, the body is unable to break down isoleucine properly. As a result, isoleucine is not con"}
