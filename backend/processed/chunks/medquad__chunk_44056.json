Other genetic changes believed to be involved in Waldenstrm macroglobulinemia have not yet been identified. Studies have found that certain regions of DNA are deleted or added in some people with the condition; however, researchers are unsure which genes in these regions are important for development of the condition. The mutations that cause Waldenstrm macroglobulinemia are acquired during a pe"}
