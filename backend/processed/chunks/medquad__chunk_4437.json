Before more cancer treatment is given, imaging tests, biopsy, or surgery are done to find out if there is cancer and how much there is.    Treatment of recurrent childhood high-grade astrocytoma may include the following:         - Surgery to remove the tumor.    -  High-dose chemotherapy with stem cell transplant."}
