Overall, more than 60 individuals with the duplication have been identified.\",GHR,22q11.2 duplication\nWhat are the genetic changes related to 22q11.2 duplication ?,\"People with 22q11.2 duplication have an extra copy of some genetic material at position q11.2 on chromosome 22. In most cases, this extra genetic material consists of a sequence of about 3 million DNA building blocks (base pairs), also written as 3 megabases (Mb).  The 3 Mb duplicated region contains 30 to 40 genes. For many of th"}
