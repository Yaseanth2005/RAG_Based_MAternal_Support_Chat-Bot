As a result, the atria aren't able to pump blood into the ventricles the way they should.\n                \nAF is bothersome but rarely life threatening, unless the atria contract very fast or blood clots form in the atria. Blood clots can occur because some blood \"\"pools\"\" in the atria instead of flowing into the ventricles. If a blood clot breaks off and travels through the bloodstream, it can reach the brain"}
