When ILS is caused by mutations in the PAFAH1B1 or TUBA1A gene, it is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, which means one copy of the altered gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder. Most cases result from new mutations in the gene and occur in people with no history of the disorder in their family.  When mutations in the DCX gene cause ILS, it is inherited in an X-linked pattern. A condition is considered X-linked if t"}
