Communication between these two cell types is necessary to direct angiogenesis and ensure the structure and integrity of blood vessels.  TEK gene mutations that cause VMCM result in a TEK receptor that is always turned on (overactive). An overactive TEK receptor is thought to disrupt the communication between endothelial cells and smooth muscle cells. It is unclear how a lack of communication between these cells causes venous malformations. These abnormal blood vesse"}
