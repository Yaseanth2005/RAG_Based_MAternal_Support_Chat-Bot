When this happens, areas of lung tissue are damaged and cannot exchange oxygen properly. This condition is known as acute chest syndrome. In acute chest syndrome, at least one segment of the lung is damaged.\n                \nThis condition is very serious and should be treated right away at a hospital.\n                \nAcute chest syndrome often starts a few days after a painful crisis begins. A lung infection may accompany acute chest syndrome."}
