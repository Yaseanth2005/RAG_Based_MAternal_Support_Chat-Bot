Mutations in the MCCC1 or MCCC2 gene reduce or eliminate the activity of 3-MCC, preventing the body from processing leucine properly. As a result, toxic byproducts of leucine processing build up to harmful levels, which can damage the brain. This damage underlies the signs and symptoms of 3-MCC deficiency.\",GHR,3-methylcrotonyl-CoA carboxylase deficiency\nIs 3-methylcrotonyl-CoA carboxylase deficien"}
